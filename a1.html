  <section>
    <h2>Resistor Calculation</h2>
    <p><strong>DC forward current (design):</strong> 20 mA = 0.02 A</p>
    <p><strong>Typical red LED forward voltage:</strong> 1.85 V</p>
    <p><strong>Required R at 5 V:</strong> R = (5 − 1.85) / 0.02 = 157.5 Ω</p>
    <p><strong>Chosen value:</strong> 220 Ω (safer, ~14.3 mA). Resistor power ≈ 0.045 W → 1/8 W or 1/4 W ok.</p>

    <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
  
    <h3>How many LEDs could you blink independently? How much current would that draw?</h3>
    <p>Up to 18 LEDs (avoid D0/D1). 330 Ω → ~9 mA each, ~163 mA total. 220 Ω → ~13.6 mA each; cap ~14 LEDs (~191 mA total).</p>
  
    <h3>How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</h3>
    <p>About 60 Hz (period ~16 ms) looks continuous.</p>
